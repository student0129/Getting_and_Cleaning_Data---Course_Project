# Getting_and_Cleaning_Data---Course_Project

The purpose of this project is to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

# Introduction

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones Here are the data for the project:https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

# Repo

This repo contains the following files:
  0. "README.md"
  1. A tidy dataset obtained by run_analysis.R called secondtidydata.txt
  2. R script that performs the analysis called run_analysis.R
  3. A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any 
     transformations or work performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md
